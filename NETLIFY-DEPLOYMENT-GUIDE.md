# Netlify Deployment Guide - Memorio Portals

**Status:** Portals Built ✅ | Ready to Deploy 🚀  
**Date:** October 11, 2025

---

## 🎯 What We've Built

You now have **3 separate portals** ready to deploy:

1. **Family Portal**: `index.html` (existing, already live)
2. **Admin Portal**: `m-admin-3k5a/` (login + invite Directors)
3. **Director Portal**: `m-director-9m6z/` (login + create cases + invite Families)

All portals use **secret URLs** for access control until you can set up subdomains.

## 🎉 You're Done!

If all steps above work, your portals are **100% functional** and ready for production use!

## 🔐 Security Notes

### **Keep These URLs Private:**
- `https://memorio.ai/m-admin-3k5a/` - Only for admins
- `https://memorio.ai/m-director-9m6z/` - Only for directors

### **How to Share Access:**
1. **For Admins**: Share the admin URL privately
2. **For Directors**: Admin creates account, shares URL + credentials
3. **For Families**: Director creates case, invites family with magic link

---

## 🔄 Upgrade to Subdomains (Later)

When you have domain access, we can upgrade to:
- `admin.memorio.ai` - Professional admin portal
- `director.memorio.ai` - Professional director portal
- `memorio.ai` - Family portal (stays the same)

This requires:
1. Adding DNS records (5 minutes)
2. Updating Netlify site settings
3. No code changes needed!

---

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### **Portal doesn't load**
- Check Netlify deployment status
- Make sure latest commit is deployed
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### **Login fails**
- Verify test accounts exist in Supabase
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Supabase URL/keys are correct in code

### **Edge Function errors**
- Verify functions are deployed in Supabase Dashboard
- Check function logs in Supabase
- Ensure user has correct role

### **"Access denied" errors**
- User may not have correct role in database
- Check `users` table in Supabase Dashboard
- Verify role matches portal (admin for Admin Portal, director for Director Portal)
